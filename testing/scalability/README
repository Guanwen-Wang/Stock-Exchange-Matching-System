To run the scalability test, do the following:

1. Go into test1 folder
2. Adjust MAX_THREAD variable in test.cpp as well as the NUM_REQUEST to send out sepecific number of requests.
3. There are roughly 10 requests in total for test2.xml and test3.xml, so the total request is roughly equal to NUM_REQUEST * MAX_THREAD * 10.
4. Run: time ./test.sh
5. After the all responses have been received, look at the real time displayed.


The results should roughly follow the pattern, and the server is able to process these requests with no interference or seg fault:

Time	   # of Request
-------------------------
0.041s	   10 requests
0.3s       100 requests
1.92s      1000 requests
13.18s     10000 requests
120.0s     100000 requests
